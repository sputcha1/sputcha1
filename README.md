Hi! I'm Srshti (she / her) and I'm currently a Senior Data Scientist at the Capital One. I finished my PhD in Statistics through the STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training (based at Lancaster University) at the end of last year. 

Alongside work, I act as Chair for the [Young Statisticians Section](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/young-statisticians/) of the RSS.
