Hi! I'm Srshti (she / her) and I'm currently a Data Scientist at the Experian DataLabs in London. I've just finished my PhD in Statistics through the STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training (based at Lancaster University). 

Alongside work, I volunteer for [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/coding-kickstarter/) and act as Chair for the [Young Statisticians Section](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/young-statisticians/) of the RSS.
